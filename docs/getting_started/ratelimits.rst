Ratelimits
==========

Even though PRAW respects the |ratelimit_header|_ and waits the appropriate time between
requests, there are other unknown ratelimits that Reddit has that might require
additional wait time (anywhere from milliseconds to minutes) for things such as
commenting, editing comments/posts, banning users, adding moderators, etc. PRAW will
sleep and try the request again if the requested wait time (as much as 600 seconds) is
less than or equal to PRAW's |ratelimit_seconds|_, PRAW will wait for the requested time
plus 1 second. If the requested wait time exceeds the set value of
``ratelimit_seconds``, PRAW will raise :class:`.RedditAPIException`.

For example, given the following :class:`.Reddit` instance:

.. code-block:: python

    import praw

    reddit = praw.Reddit(..., ratelimit_seconds=300)

Let's say your bot posts a comment to Reddit every 30 seconds and Reddit returns the
ratelimit error: ``"You're doing that too much. Try again in 3 minutes."``. PRAW will
wait for 181 seconds since 181 seconds is less than the configured ``ratelimit_seconds``
of 300 seconds. However, if Reddit returns the ratelimit error: ``"You're doing that too
much. Try again in 6 minutes."``, PRAW will raise an exception since 360 seconds is
greater than the configured ``ratelimit_seconds`` of 300 seconds.
