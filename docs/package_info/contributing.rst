Contributing to PRAW
====================

PRAW gladly welcomes new contributions. As with most larger projects, we have an
established consistent way of doing things. A consistent style increases readability,
decreases bug-potential and makes it faster to understand how everything works together.

PRAW follows :PEP:`8` and :PEP:`257`. `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`_ is used to
manage a suite of pre-commit hooks that enforce conformance with these PEPs along with
several other checks. Additionally, the ``pre_push.py`` script can be used to run the
full pre-commit suite and the docs build prior to submitting a pull request. The
following are PRAW-specific guidelines in addition to those PEPs.

.. note::

    In order to use the pre-commit hooks and the ``pre_push.py`` dependencies, install
    PRAW's ``[lint]`` extra, followed by the appropriate pre-commit command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install praw[lint]
        pre-commit install

    If you are using ``zsh`` for your shell, you will need to double-quote
    ``"praw[lint]"`` like so:

    .. code-block:: zsh

        pip install "praw[lint]"
        pre-commit install

Code
----

- Within a single file classes are sorted alphabetically where inheritance permits.
- Within a class, methods are sorted alphabetically within their respective groups with
  the following as the grouping order:

  - Static methods
  - Class methods
  - Cached properties
  - Properties
  - Instance Methods

- Use descriptive names for the catch-all keyword argument. E.g., ``**other_options``
  rather than ``**kwargs``.
- Methods with more than one argument should have all its arguments sorted
  alphabetically and marked as keyword only with the ``*`` argument. For example:

  .. code-block:: python

      class ExampleClass:
          def example_method(
              self,
              *,
              arg1,
              arg2,
              optional_arg1=None,
          ):
              ...

  There is some exceptions to this:

  - If itâ€™s clear without reading documentation what the mandatory positional arguments
    would be and their order, then they can be positional arguments. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        class ExampleClass:
            def pair(self, left, right):
                ...

  - If there is one or two mandatory arguments and some optional arguments, then the
    mandatory arguments may be positional (as long as it adheres to the previous point),
    however, the optional arguments must be made keyword only and sorted alphabetically.
    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        class Subreddit:
            def submit(
                self,
                title,
                *,
                collection_id=None,
                discussion_type=None,
                draft_id=None,
                flair_id=None,
                flair_text=None,
                inline_media=None,
                nsfw=False,
                resubmit=True,
                selftext=None,
                send_replies=True,
                spoiler=False,
                url=None,
            ):
                ...

Testing
-------

Contributions to PRAW requires 100% test coverage as reported by `Coveralls
<https://coveralls.io/github/praw-dev/praw>`_. If you know how to add a feature, but
aren't sure how to write the necessary tests, please open a pull request anyway so we
can work with you to write the necessary tests.

Running the Test Suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`GitHub Actions <https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/actions>`_ automatically runs all
updates to known branches and pull requests. However, it's useful to be able to run the
tests locally. The simplest way is via:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest

Without any configuration or modification, all the tests should pass. If they do not,
please file a bug report.

Adding and Updating Integration Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PRAW's integration tests utilize `Betamax <https://betamax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
to record an interaction with Reddit. The recorded interaction is then replayed for
subsequent test runs.

To safely record a cassette without leaking your account credentials, PRAW utilizes a
number of environment variables which are replaced with placeholders in the cassettes.
The environment variables are (listed in bash export format):

.. code-block:: bash

    export prawtest_client_id=myclientid
    export prawtest_client_secret=myclientsecret
    export prawtest_password=mypassword
    export prawtest_test_subreddit=test
    export prawtest_username=myusername
    export prawtest_user_agent=praw_pytest

By setting these environment variables prior to running ``pytest``, when adding or
updating cassettes, instances of ``mypassword`` will be replaced by the placeholder text
``<PASSWORD>`` and similar for the other environment variables.

To use a refresh token instead of username/password set ``prawtest_refresh_token``
instead of ``prawtest_password`` and ``prawtest_username``.

When adding or updating a cassette, you will likely want to force requests to occur
again rather than using an existing cassette. The simplest way to rebuild a cassette is
to first delete it, and then rerun the test suite.

Please always verify that only the requests you expect to be made are contained within
your cassette.

Documentation
-------------

- All publicly available functions, classes, and modules should have a docstring.
- All documentation files and docstrings should be linted and formatted by
  ``docstrfmt``.
- Use correct terminology. A subreddit's fullname is something like ``t5_xyfc7``. The
  correct term for a subreddit's "name" like `python <https://www.reddit.com/r/python>`_
  is its display name.

Static Checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PRAW's test suite comes with a checker tool that can warn you of using incorrect
documentation styles (using ``.. code::`` instead of ``.. code-block::``, using ``/r/``
instead of ``r/``, etc.). This is run automatically by the pre-commit hooks and the
``pre_push.py`` script.

.. autoclass:: tools.static_word_checks.StaticChecker
    :inherited-members:
